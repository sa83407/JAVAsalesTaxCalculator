# JAVAsalesTaxCalculator
This program calculates the basic sales tax and prints a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. First, the program prompts the user to input the filename (ex: Input1.txt). The program then checks if the filename exists in the directory and if the file is in the proper format. If the file exists and is in the proper format, the program reads the contents of the file and separates the file contents according to price, item description, and number of items. If the file doesn't exist or isn't in the correct format, the program prints an error message and ends the program. Keywords for books, food, and medical products are checked in the item description to exclude those items from being taxed. The item description is also scanned for imported goods and they are taxed an additional 5% with no exemptions. This process will repeat as long as the user inputs an existing filename (or q to quit).
